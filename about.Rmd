I have spent my life in reverence of the natural world. Growing up in the woods of central New York, I was fascinated by annual cycles, and enjoyed watching the way that nature adjusted to intense seasonal shifts there. Inspired to learn more about these processes, I pursued a B.S. in Chemistry from the State University of New York at Geneseo. Following that, I intended to pursue a career in environmental science, but first took time to re-focus. In a gap year, I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail among other mountain pursuits, searching for a way to connect my professional and personal interests.  
&nbsp;  
I since received a PhD in Agricultural and Environmental Chemistry from the University of California, Davis, where I applied my knowledge of chemistry to study the impacts of climate change on water and carbon cycles in forests, putting my research into the context of both conservation and management of natural resources. My work has brought attention to the under-appreciated role of soils in stabilizing the response of forests to climate change.

I recently accepted a position as a Post-Doctoral Scholar in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere lab at the University of Oregon, where my research will focus on questions of scale in ecology. With support from friend and advisor Lucas Silva, in addition to National Geographic, I am currently working on a project titled ‘The climate paradox: mapping resilience and vulnerability of montane forests’ seeking to resolve the uncertainty between stresses experienced by individual trees, and how that is reflected by landscape scale processes. My work makes fundamental observations about how trees respond to environmental change, leveraging trees and their history through growth rings as the protagonist in the story of landscape evolution.

In my free time you'll find me skiing, mountain biking, hiking, and doing whatever I can to get outside and enjoy the fresh air!
